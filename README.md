# CLIK Interview BE Code samples ðŸ¤– 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to project sample created by CLIK devs ðŸ¥·.

In order to complete this task, you should review the project code and prepare your `report`(repo FORK => PR/New Issue etc;).

# Task Hints

Concentrate on: 
- BE basics for Nodejs App
- REST
- SOLID

Forget about:
- business area context
- syntax typos
- missing import/method implementation

Additional notes: it's just samples, no npm commands, no node_modules, all dependencies are invented intentionally. Project business area was chosen as food delivery just for example.
